# LingoApp
Spring MVC Project applying concepts I learn through another tutorial.

2 OCT, 2021 : I was fighting with this project to get it to work the same way I made the tutorial's project work... I am so stupid. 2 days... 2 days missing the most essential annotation. @Configuration. GRRRR But it is working now and it is bidning. I also learn to kill tomcat when it stops working for some random reason. Now to continue the lessons and see all I can add to this. Mainly first saving teh words guessed to be counted later as well as scored.

6 OCT, 2021 : Validation works after 8+ hours. Session and Cookies work after just 2. Validation was killing me. I think in teh end it was a matter of updating Spring 5.2 to 5.3...

11 OCT, 2021 : Able to display results and all data. Also able to retrieve result according to answer if correct or no or if attempts run out. 
Validation still work, but I had to scratch scope for now. First I will build all I need.
After that, I will apply scope when I understand it better, hoping this helps with the loop of the game.
Currently if I run out of attempts, it will be Game Over, until I restart server.
